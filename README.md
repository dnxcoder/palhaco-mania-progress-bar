"# palhaco-mania-progress-bar" 

This is an progress bar api designed for a clown entertainment service.

How to use -


1) - Import the clownpg.js file to your website.

2) - Import this google font link to your HTML <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fredoka+One&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

3) - Make a container with a class called "containerClownpg".

4) - Inside of this container you can add 5 different images, that will show up next to the pins of the progress bar, for this use the "img" html tag with the classes "image-step-(number)".

5) - To make the proggresbar go to the next step you just need to implement the css class "buttonNext" to any HTML element like a div.

Enjoy :D
